## Hi there üëã
Hi! I'm Sravani Tangallapally, someone who enjoys building meaningful tech solutions that blend AI/ML with real-world usability. I have hands-on experience with Python, machine learning, and the MERN stack, and I love working on projects that make a difference.

While I don‚Äôt consider myself a hardcore coder, I‚Äôm confident in my problem-solving abilities, value team collaboration, and take initiative when it comes to learning and leading. My work often focuses on bridging intelligent systems with intuitive design‚Äîwhether it's through front-end interfaces or AI-driven models.

### Projects I Worked On

- **Alzheimer's Disease Detection using Deep Learning**  
  A deep learning-based web application that classifies MRI brain scans into different stages of Alzheimer's disease (Non-Demented, Very Mild, Mild, Moderate). Built using a custom CNN with TensorFlow and Keras, and deployed with Streamlit for real-time predictions, confidence scores, and downloadable reports.

- **Smart Crop Selector using Machine Learning**  
  A location and soil-based crop recommendation system using machine learning algorithms. Helps farmers choose the most suitable crop by analyzing parameters like soil type, temperature, and rainfall. Built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

- **E-Commerce Website using MERN Stack**  
  A full-fledged e-commerce platform with product listings, dynamic cart functionality, and responsive UI. Built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Frontend is fully functional with routing and component-based structure; backend integration is in progress.
